<!-- Hello World! Some HTML basics from research I conducted on my own.

    Basic HTML document structure/anatomy of a webpage: -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Title Here</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

<!-- Tags are the building blocks of HTML, define the structure of content and are enclosed in opening and closing brackets '< >'.
Example: -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Attributes provide additional information about the element, and are added within the opening tag.
Example: -->

<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>

<!-- Common elements:
<h1> to <h6>: Headings (from most important <h1> to least important <h6>).
<p>: Paragraph.
<a>: Anchor for hyperlinks.
<img>: Image.
<ul>: Unordered list.
<ol>: Ordered list.
<li>: List item.
<div>: Division or section in a document.
<span>: Inline container. 
    
Extra spaces, tabs and line breaks are ignored in HTML 


The WWW (World Wide Web): An interconnected system of hypertext documents accessible via the Internet. 
Users navigate through web pages using hyperlinks, accessing information like text, images, and videos hosted on servers 
worldwide. Created in 1989, the WWW revolutionized how people communicate and access information online. 
It's a fundamental aspect of the Internet, enabling sharing and exploration of digital content across the globe.
